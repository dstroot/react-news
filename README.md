TODO

- [ ] Fix Firebase Tests https://github.com/soumak77/firebase-mock/blob/HEAD/tutorials/client/firestore.md
- [ ] Add Pagination to lists
- [ ] Story search function
- [ ] List of improvements:
  - Sorting stories by year on current site makes the start of the year "low" and the end of the year "high" in terms of content. Might it be better to simply alway have the last 10-20 stories showing all the time?
  - Add images to stories to add visual interest
  - Add a "lead story" - highlight the most recent story posted
  - Add categories to stories to help with search
  - Logo/Image library
  - Story CMS system
  - Why are current contacts individuals? Most companies use a functional contact (e.g. "media" or "publicrelations")
  - provide easy back button at the bottom to return to the main list
